Certainly, I'll provide a detailed explanation of the given C++ code for the "Ebony and Ivory" problem from Codeforces.

Problem Statement:
Given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, you need to determine if it's possible to obtain the weight `c` using the weights `a` and `b`, with an unlimited supply of each weight.

Explanation of the Code:

1. **Header Includes and Namespace Declaration**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
```
Here, we include the necessary header files for input/output and vector usage. The `using namespace std;` statement allows us to use standard C++ functions without specifying the namespace.

2. **Constant and Input**:
```cpp
const int INF = 1e9;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
```
We define a constant `INF` (infinity) to represent a large value. We then read the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the weights of ebony and ivory, and the desired total weight, respectively.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**:
```cpp
    vector<int> dp(c + 1, INF);
    dp[0] = 0;
```
We create a vector `dp` of size `c + 1`, where each element stores the minimum number of steps needed to obtain the corresponding weight. We initialize all elements to a large value (`INF`) to indicate that these weights are not yet reachable. We set `dp[0]` to 0 because starting with a weight of 0 requires no additional steps.

4. **Dynamic Programming Update Loop**:
```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i <= c; ++i) {
        if (dp[i] != INF) {
            if (i + a <= c) {
                dp[i + a] = min(dp[i + a], dp[i] + 1);
            }
            if (i + b <= c) {
                dp[i + b] = min(dp[i + b], dp[i] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
```
We iterate through each weight from 0 to `c` and update the `dp` values. For each weight `i`, if it's reachable (i.e., `dp[i]` is not `INF`), we consider two cases:
- Adding weight `a` to the current weight `i` and updating the minimum steps needed for the new weight.
- Adding weight `b` to the current weight `i` and updating the minimum steps needed for the new weight.

We use the `min` function to keep track of the minimum steps required to reach each weight.

5. **Output the Result**:
```cpp
    if (dp[c] == INF) {
        cout << "No\n";
    } else {
        cout << "Yes\n";
    }
```
Finally, we check whether it's possible to obtain the desired weight `c`. If `dp[c]` remains as `INF`, it means that weight `c` cannot be obtained using weights `a` and `b`. Otherwise, we output "Yes". If `dp[c]` is not `INF`, it means that it's possible to reach weight `c` using the given weights.

6. **Return Statement**:
```cpp

    return 0;
}
```
The `main` function ends and returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

To use this code, input the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and run the program. It will output whether it's possible to obtain the desired weight `c` using the provided weights `a` and `b`.
